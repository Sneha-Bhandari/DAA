1) learned about increment and decrement while doing sorting algorithm:
      inside increment there are again two types : 
      post increment denoted by variable++
      pre increment denoted by ++variable
  same as on decrement like variable-- and --variable
  if we are given:
	 int x=0;
	 int y=x++;
		 the value of x is 1 and value of y is 0
		 but in pre increment the value of x will be 0 and y will be 1

 Web technology:
		 Now I learned how to make form, table, and other HTML tags
		 
Cryptography:
	 Meet -in-middle -attack: it is used in 2DES and 3DES
	 Finite Field/Galois Field: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division(different methods used)
	 
Simulation:
		Physical Model : Static and Dynamic
			static means the model that doesn't change with time
				dynamic means the model that changes with respect with time.
